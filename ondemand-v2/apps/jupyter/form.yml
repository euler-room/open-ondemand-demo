#     cluster: "owens"
cluster: "hpc"

# Define attribute values that aren't meant to be modified by the user within
# the Dashboard form
attributes:
  # Set the corresponding modules that need to be loaded for Jupyter to run
  #
  # @note It is called within the batch job as `module load <modules>` if
  #   defined
  # @example Do not load any modules
  #     modules: ""
  # @example Using default python module
  #     modules: "python"
  # @example Using specific python module
  #     modules: "python/3.5"
  # @example Using combination of modules
  #     modules: "python/3.5 cuda/8.0.44"
  modules: ""

  # Any extra command line arguments to feed to the `jupyter notebook ...`
  # command that launches the Jupyter notebook within the batch job
  extra_jupyter_args: ""

# All of the attributes that make up the Dashboard form (in respective order),
# and made available to the submit configuration file and the template ERB
# files
