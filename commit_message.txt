Upgrade Open OnDemand to 4.0+ on Rocky Linux 9 with simplified architecture

Major Changes:
- Upgraded base OS from CentOS to Rocky Linux 9
- Upgraded Open OnDemand from 3.x to 4.0.5
- Removed XDMoD and ColdFront dependencies completely
- Switched from LDAP to file-based authentication for simplicity

Technical Fixes:
- Added ondemand-dex package to Dockerfile for authentication service
- Fixed MUNGE directory permissions in entrypoint script
- Made Dex authentication service optional (using file-based auth instead)
- Fixed nginx_stage configuration:
  - Corrected pun_config_path to use file pattern instead of directory
  - Updated nginx binary path to /opt/rh/ondemand/root/usr/sbin/nginx
- Added local user creation in ondemand container
- Created htpasswd file for Apache Basic authentication
- Added LDAP environment variables to docker-compose.yml

Documentation Updates:
- Updated README.md to reflect file-based authentication
- Created SETUP_NOTES.md with detailed setup and troubleshooting guide
- Removed all references to XDMoD and ColdFront from:
  - docs/acknowledgments.md
  - docs/applications.md
  - docs/getting_started.md
  - docs/docker_tips.md
- Updated user account information in documentation
- Emphasized use of ./hpcts script for managing the environment

The demo environment now starts cleanly with './hpcts start' and provides
a fully functional Open OnDemand 4.0+ interface without external dependencies.
